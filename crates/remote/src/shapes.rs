/// Macro to construct a `ShapeDefinition` with compile-time SQL validation.
///
/// The SQL validation uses `sqlx::query!` to ensure at compile time that:
/// - The table exists
/// - The columns in the WHERE clause exist
/// - The SQL syntax is correct
///
/// Usage:
/// ```ignore
/// pub const PROJECT_SHAPE: ShapeDefinition = define_shape!(
///     table: "projects",
///     ts_type_name: "Project",
///     where_clause: r#""organization_id" = $1"#,
///     url: "/shape/projects",
///     params: ["organization_id"]
/// );
/// ```
