//! Shape definitions for realtime streaming.
//!
//! This module provides the core shape infrastructure:
//! - `ShapeDefinition<T>` struct for shape metadata
//! - `ShapeExport` trait for heterogeneous shape collections
//! - `define_shape!` macro for compile-time SQL validation
//!
//! The `define_entity!` macro in the `entity` module uses `define_shape!` internally.
//! Shape constants are re-exported from the `entities` module for convenience.

/// ```ignore

///     where_clause: r#""organization_id" = $1"#,
///     url: "/shape/projects",
